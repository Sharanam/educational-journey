                            <p>In other hand, I found that the administration of GDCST and SP University is, comparatively, much better. The environment was the different at whole level, teachers were supportive and most importantly I get to travel by the
                                Indian Railways, which allowed me to explore so many things. (It made me realize how curious I am to explore the things)</p>

                <p>Socially, I do not get much involved, especially in family functions. I love to be silent and observe everything. It allows me to focus on my job. I have very small friend circle, but that is enough for me.</p>
                <p>In weekends, I like to stay in the natural scenery like garden, etc. and mostly am sitting alone. I always try to manage my calmness.</p>
                <p>Whenever I do socializing, I try to learn their perceptives. How they observe the facts and criticize/appreciate them!</p>
